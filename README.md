# Pymaceuticals-challenge


Project to analyze recent animal study for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiated by Pymaceuticals Inc., pharmaceutical company specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. 


In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, *Capomulin*, versus the other treatment regimens.

### Here are just a few observations that can be made based on the data:

* The study had almost equal participation of male and female mice.

* In the group of four treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) only Infubinol had one outlier data point.

* The measured average tumor volume and the weight for mice on Capomulin treatment had strong positive correlation between both factors with the correlation coefficient equal to 0.84

* The drug of interest, Capomulin, proved to effectively reduce average tumor volume over period of 45 days. 
Another drug with a similar effect to Capomulin in reducing tumor volume was Ramicane.
